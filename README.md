## Year round weather analysis
### Overview of Project:
---We are conducting research on weather data for the island of Oahu using historical data points consisting of temperature and dates for the month of June and December every year from 2010 to 2018. The purpose is to generate a trend analysis of the average temperatures and provide a predictive model to determine the sustainability of a surf and ice cream business year-round
### Analysis and Challenges:
#### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
---Using 'Python', 'Pandas' and 'SQLAlchemy' data was retrieved and filtered by the date column of the Measurements table and the temperature columns for the months of June by using the 'extract' dependency. Once extracted, statistical analysis was performed using the 'describe method' which yielded the average temperature, standard deviation, min/max temp and quartiles. Some challenges discoverd was understanding how to use the extract dependency, which took only a few minutes of research via supporting documentation to perform the correct code execution.
#### Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
---This research was the same as the research for June with the difference of passing the month value equal to 12 in the filter function. Once an 'empty list' was created then the variable defined, then it could be set equal to the code via 'Python', 'Pandas' and 'SQLAlchemy'. The statistics were once again retrieved and allowed for a comparison of the two yields.
### Results:
---Once compared it was easy to see that there were generally colder temperatures in December than in June as shown by the statistical comparison in ![Statistical Data](https://github.com/jobloom79/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Statistics.png) A few other results discovered were there are more dates to generate information from in June and therefore more likely days to have the shop open for business. To get a better representation of the data a plot for June and a plot for December was created using 'matplotlib'. This data provided a slight skew to the right in the December data indicating more warmer months in the range of data. This can be viewed on the "June_Temps" and "Dec_Temps" histogram ![June_Temps](https://github.com/jobloom79/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/June_Temps.png) and ![December_Temps](https://github.com/jobloom79/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/December_Temps.png)
### Summary: 
---In Summary the results help to provide a predictive model of what to expect during the warm and cold months of the year. The analysis gives insight into the general amount of time the business can run and provides evidence that even in the colder months there are still a large frequencies of days above 70 allowing the surf business to thrive and generate income the majority of the year.
